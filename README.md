# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project
A real life data science project on building a real estate price prediction website.  
Building a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.


During model building for this project I will be coverring almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 
Technologies and tools I would be using in this project are:
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

NOTE: CURRENTLY WOKRING ON THIS PROJECT SO THE READ ME FILE IS NOT UP TO DATE!
